# Intro
For this guide you will need the demo game client. This can be downloaded below:
[Windows](https://localhost/)
[macOS](https://localhost/)
[Linux](https://localhost/)
On Linux you will also need to install Love2D (`sudo apt-get install love`).
You will also need to be logged into your game control [panel](https://panel.planetaryprocessing.io/).

# Quick Start Guide
1. Launch the demo client and connect to your world, you can do this with the following command:
```
Windows: demo.exe <gameid> <username> <password>
macOS: demo.app <gameid> <username> <password>
Linux: love demo.app <gameid> <username> <password>
```
2. Explore your world, you should see some entities moving around. You should also see yourself moving around on the control panel. Now is a good time to explore the control panel and its monitoring features.
3. In this repository, try editing the behaviour of one of the entities (e.g. the cat). For example, by making it come to the nearest player.
4. Commit and push this code.
5. Stop your game on the control panel.
6. On the control panel, select the 'deploy new version' option.
7. Start your game and reconnect.
8. Observe the new behaviour; any errors you encounter can be viewed on the control panel.
